## 🚀 Quick Start

### 60 Seconds to Contributing (Development)

When developing and testing **in your fork**:

```bash
# 1. Fork on GitHub
# Visit: https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE → Fork (top right)

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ProxmoxVE.git
cd ProxmoxVE

# 3. Auto-configure your fork (IMPORTANT - updates all links!)
bash docs/contribution/setup-fork.sh --full

# 4. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-app

# 5. Read the guides
cat docs/README.md              # Documentation overview
cat docs/ct/DETAILED_GUIDE.md   # For container scripts
cat docs/install/DETAILED_GUIDE.md  # For install scripts

# 6. Create your contribution
cp docs/contribution/templates_ct/AppName.sh ct/myapp.sh
cp docs/contribution/templates_install/AppName-install.sh install/myapp-install.sh
# ... edit files ...

# 7. Push to your fork and test via GitHub
git push origin feature/my-awesome-app
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/myapp.sh)"
# ⏱️ GitHub may take 10-30 seconds to update files - be patient!

# 8. Request website metadata via the website
# Go to the script's page on the website, use the "Report issue" button — it will guide you.

# 9. No direct install-script test
# Install scripts are executed by the CT script inside the container

# 10. Commit ONLY your new files (see Cherry-Pick section below!)
git add ct/myapp.sh install/myapp-install.sh
git commit -m "feat: add MyApp container and install scripts"
git push origin feature/my-awesome-app

# 11. Create Pull Request on GitHub
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: After setup-fork.sh, many files are modified!**

See the **Cherry-Pick: Submitting Only Your Changes** section below to learn how to push ONLY your 2 files instead of 600+ modified files!

### How Users Run Scripts (After Merged)

Once your script is merged to the main repository, users download and run it from GitHub like this:

```bash
# ✅ Users run from GitHub (normal usage after PR merged)
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/myapp.sh)"

# Install scripts are called by the CT script and are not run directly by users
```

### Development vs. Production Execution

**During Development (you, in your fork):**

```bash
# You MUST test via curl from your GitHub fork (not local files!)
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/myapp.sh)"

# The script's curl commands are updated by setup-fork.sh to point to YOUR fork
# This ensures you're testing your actual changes
# ⏱️ Wait 10-30 seconds after pushing - GitHub updates slowly
```

**After Merge (users, from GitHub):**

```bash
# Users download the script from upstream via curl
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/myapp.sh)"

# The script's curl commands now point back to upstream (community-scripts)
# This is the stable, tested version
```

**Summary:**

- **Development**: Push to fork, test via curl → setup-fork.sh changes curl URLs to your fork
- **Production**: curl | bash from upstream → curl URLs point to community-scripts repo

---

## 🍴 Setting Up Your Fork

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)

When you clone your fork, run the setup script to automatically configure everything:

```bash
bash docs/contribution/setup-fork.sh --full
```

**What it does:**

- Auto-detects your GitHub username from git config
- Auto-detects your fork repository name
- Updates **ALL** hardcoded links to point to your fork instead of the main repo (`--full`)
- Creates `.git-setup-info` with your configuration
- Allows you to develop and test independently in your fork

**Why this matters:**

Without running this script, all links in your fork will still point to the upstream repository (community-scripts). This is a problem when testing because:

- Installation links will pull from upstream, not your fork
- Updates will target the wrong repository
- Your contributions won't be properly tested

**After running setup-fork.sh:**

Your fork is fully configured and ready to develop. You can:

- Push changes to your fork
- Test via curl: `bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/myapp.sh)"`
- All links will reference your fork for development
- ⏱️ Wait 10-30 seconds after pushing - GitHub takes time to update
- Commit and push with confidence
- Create a PR to merge into upstream

**See**: [FORK_SETUP.md](FORK_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions

### Manual Setup

If the script doesn't work, manually configure:

```bash
# Set git user
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Add upstream remote for syncing with main repo
git remote add upstream https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE.git

# Verify remotes
git remote -v
# Should show: origin (your fork) and upstream (main repo)
```

## 🍒 Cherry-Pick: Submitting Only Your Changes

**Problem**: `setup-fork.sh` modifies 600+ files to update links. You don't want to submit all of those changes - only your new 2 files!

**Solution**: Use git cherry-pick to select only YOUR files.

### Step-by-Step Cherry-Pick Guide

#### 1. Check what changed

```bash
# See all modified files
git status

# Verify your files are there
git status | grep -E "ct/myapp|install/myapp"
```

#### 2. Create a clean feature branch for submission

```bash
# Go back to upstream main (clean slate)
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b submit/myapp upstream/main

# Don't use your modified main branch!
```

#### 3. Cherry-pick ONLY your files

Cherry-picking extracts specific changes from commits:

```bash
# Option A: Cherry-pick commits that added your files
# (if you committed your files separately)
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-of-your-files>

# Option B: Manually copy and commit only your files
# From your work branch, get the file contents
git show feature/my-awesome-app:ct/myapp.sh > /tmp/myapp.sh
git show feature/my-awesome-app:install/myapp-install.sh > /tmp/myapp-install.sh

# Add them to the clean branch
cp /tmp/myapp.sh ct/myapp.sh
cp /tmp/myapp-install.sh install/myapp-install.sh

# Commit
git add ct/myapp.sh install/myapp-install.sh
git commit -m "feat: add MyApp"
```

#### 4. Verify only your files are in the PR

```bash
# Check git diff against upstream
git diff upstream/main --name-only
# Should show ONLY:
#   ct/myapp.sh
#   install/myapp-install.sh
```

#### 5. Push and create PR

```bash
# Push your clean submission branch
git push origin submit/myapp

# Create PR on GitHub from: submit/myapp → main
```

### Why This Matters

- ✅ Clean PR with only your changes
- ✅ Easier for maintainers to review
- ✅ Faster merge without conflicts
- ❌ Without cherry-pick: PR has 600+ file changes (won't merge!)

### If You Made a Mistake

```bash
# Delete the messy branch
git branch -D submit/myapp

# Go back to clean branch
git checkout -b submit/myapp upstream/main

# Try cherry-picking again
```

If you're using **Visual Studio Code** with an AI assistant, you can leverage our detailed guidelines to generate high-quality contributions automatically.

### How to Use AI Assistance

1. **Open the AI Guidelines**

   ```
   docs/contribution/AI.md
   ```

   This file contains all requirements, patterns, and examples for writing proper scripts.

2. **Prepare Your Information**

   Before asking the AI to generate code, gather:
   - **Repository URL**: e.g., `https://github.com/owner/myapp`
   - **Dockerfile/Script**: Paste the app's installation instructions (if available)
   - **Dependencies**: What packages does it need? (Node, Python, Java, PostgreSQL, etc.)
   - **Ports**: What port does it listen on? (e.g., 3000, 8080, 5000)
   - **Configuration**: Any environment variables or config files?

3. **Tell the AI Assistant**

   Share with the AI:
   - The repository URL
   - The Dockerfile or install instructions
   - Link to [docs/contribution/AI.md](AI.md) with instructions to follow

   **Example prompt:**

   ```
   I want to contribute a container script for MyApp to ProxmoxVE.
   Repository: https://github.com/owner/myapp

   Here's the Dockerfile:
   [paste Dockerfile content]

   Please follow the guidelines in docs/contribution/AI.md to create:
   1. ct/myapp.sh (container script)
   2. install/myapp-install.sh (installation script)

   Website listing/metadata is requested separately via the website (Report issue on the script page).
   ```

4. **AI Will Generate**

   The AI will produce scripts that:
   - Follow all ProxmoxVE patterns and conventions
   - Use helper functions from `tools.func` correctly
   - Include proper error handling and messages
   - Have correct update mechanisms
   - Are ready to submit as a PR

   Website listing/metadata is requested separately via the website (Report issue on the script page).

### Key Points for AI Assistants

- **Templates Location**: `docs/contribution/templates_ct/AppName.sh`, `templates_install/`, `templates_json/`
- **Guidelines**: Must follow `docs/contribution/AI.md` exactly
- **Helper Functions**: Use only functions from `misc/tools.func` - never write custom ones
- **Testing**: Always test before submission via curl from your fork
  ```bash
  bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/myapp.sh)"
  # Wait 10-30 seconds after pushing changes
  ```
- **No Docker**: Container scripts must be bare-metal, not Docker-based

### Benefits

- **Speed**: AI generates boilerplate in seconds
- **Consistency**: Follows same patterns as 200+ existing scripts
- **Quality**: Less bugs and more maintainable code
- **Learning**: See how your app should be structured

## ❓ FAQ

### ❌ Why can't I test with `bash ct/myapp.sh` locally?

You might try:

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - This won't test your actual changes!
bash ct/myapp.sh
./ct/myapp.sh
sh ct/myapp.sh
```

**Why this fails:**

- `bash ct/myapp.sh` uses the LOCAL clone file
- The LOCAL file doesn't execute the curl commands - it's already on disk
- The curl URLs INSIDE the script are modified by setup-fork.sh, but they're not executed
- So you can't verify if your curl URLs actually work
- Users will get the curl URL version (which may be broken)

**Solution:** Always test via curl from GitHub:

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Tests the actual GitHub URLs
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/myapp.sh)"
```

### ❓ How do I test my changes?

You **cannot** test locally with `bash ct/myapp.sh` from your cloned directory!

You **must** push to GitHub and test via curl from your fork:

```bash
# 1. Push your changes to your fork
git push origin feature/my-awesome-app

# 2. Test via curl (this loads the script from GitHub, not local files)
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/my-app.sh)"

# 3. For verbose/debug output, pass environment variables
VERBOSE=yes bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/my-app.sh)"
DEV_MODE_LOGS=true bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/my-app.sh)"
```

**Why?**

- Local `bash ct/myapp.sh` uses local files from your clone
- But the script's INTERNAL curl commands have been modified by setup-fork.sh to point to your fork
- This discrepancy means you're not actually testing the curl URLs
- Testing via curl ensures the script downloads from YOUR fork GitHub URLs
- ⏱️ **Important:** GitHub takes 10-30 seconds to recognize newly pushed files. Wait before testing!

**What if local bash worked?**

You'd be testing local files only, not the actual GitHub URLs that users will download. This means broken curl links wouldn't be caught during testing.

### What if my PR has conflicts?

```bash
# Sync with upstream main repository
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

# Resolve conflicts in your editor
git add .
git rebase --continue
git push -f origin your-branch
```

### How do I keep my fork updated?

Two ways:

**Option 1: Run setup script again**

```bash
bash docs/contribution/setup-fork.sh --full
```

**Option 2: Manual sync**

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git push -f origin main
```

### Where do I ask questions?

- **GitHub Issues**: For bugs and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: For general questions and ideas
- **Discord**: Community-scripts server for real-time chat
